bootstrap-compiled
==================

bootstrap.css compiled from source.

This is from the master branch, which is really no different than the bootstrap.css you could download from anywhere else.

Much more interesting is the https://github.com/donquixote/bootstrap-compiled/tree/xs-AB-subdivision branch, which introduces a new break point at 480px!
